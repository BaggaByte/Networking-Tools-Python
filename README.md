# Networking & Cybersecurity Tools

A collection of Python scripts designed to automate networking tasks and visualize core IT concepts. This repository is part of my journey as a BCA student specializing in Cybersecurity.

## 🛠 Project 1: Subnet & IP Analyzer

This tool helps visualize how IPv4 addresses are processed by hardware by converting decimal IPs into their binary equivalents and identifying Network/Host portions.

### 🚀 Features
- Converts standard IPv4 (Decimal) to Binary.
- Identifies Network vs. Host bit distribution based on CIDR notation.
- Helps students and IT professionals visualize subnetting logic.

### 📖 Learning Objectives
By building this, I mastered:
- The relationship between IP addresses and the 32-bit binary system.
- How Subnet Masks act as "filters" for network traffic.
- Python string manipulation and bitwise logic concepts.

### 💻 How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python subnet_analyzer.py
